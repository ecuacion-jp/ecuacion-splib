/**
 * Throws {@code FormInputValidationException}.
 * 
 * <p>This method validates the form again to get the appropriate messages.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Originally, I would have left it to spring mvc's validation, 
 * but the following two points are not acceptable.
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>the sorting order of multiple error messages changes each time you run it.</li>
 * <li>Validations such as @Size are not defined to ignore blank, 
 *     so validations such as @Size will return "false" 
 *     even if the value is blank and @NotEmpty is set to the variable.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>About 1, spring mvc standard validation error messages 
 *     are obtained from {@code #fields.errors} at thymeleaf.
 *     I tried to sort the list from java, {@code bindingResult.getFieldErrors()}
 *     is unmodifiable.</p>
