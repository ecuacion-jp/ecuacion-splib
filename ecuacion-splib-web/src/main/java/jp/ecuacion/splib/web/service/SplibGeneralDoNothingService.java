/**
 * Provides a general service with no method.

 * <p>It is useful when general page is needed but no service is needed.
 *     It happens when a form exists in a page but no need to process the result of the input form.
 *     For instance, login page is often the case because login procedure is not implemented 
 *     by the controller, because the spring security does it instead.</p>
