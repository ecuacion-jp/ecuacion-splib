   * Offers a utility function to upsert database safely in the library.
   * 
   * <p>In jpa or spring data jpa world, what you have to do to insert is to 
   *     {@code repository.save(e)}.<br>
   *     And no need to do anything to update thanks to "dirty checking"
   *     (jpa automatically detects and updates changes of managed entities on commit).<br><br>
   *     But the feature of the library conflicts with dirty checking fefature.<br>
   *     The library supports "soft delete flag" feature, which should delete key-duplicated 
   *     soft-deleted record on insert or update.<br><br>
   *     We can hook "insert" and delete duplicated soft-deleted record
   *     because "save()" method is always called (it's done in {@code SplibSoftDeleteAdvice}), 
   *     but "update" we cannot because no method is called 
   *     during the update derived from "dirty checking".<br><br>
   *     To prevent primary key duplication (which does not happen in principle 
   *     because the library needs surrogate key strategy) or unique key dupliication on update
   *     in the library environment, we need to use {@code save()} to realize hook.<br>
   *     But it's not enough because when you call {@code save()}, 
   *     updates derived from "dirty checking" processed right before the hook procedure processed.
   *     That's why in this method "detach()" firstly to disable "dirty checking",
   *     then save to prevent key duplication on update.
   * </p>
